#### Cloud Religion Principles

- **Resource Flexibility**: Create and test resources quickly, even at production scale, allowing for rapid innovation and testing.
  
1. **Reliability**: Design for failure isolation; ensure one component's failure doesn't impact others, leveraging cloud resilience.
2. **Scalability**: Enable systems to grow seamlessly with demand.
3. **Think in Services, Not Servers**: Focus on using managed services over self-managed servers for efficiency and scalability.

#### Cloud Best Practices

- **Scalability**: Employ both horizontal (adding more instances) and vertical (upgrading instance size) scaling.
- **Disposable Resources**: Treat servers as ephemeral and easily replaceable.
- **Automation**: Use serverless computing, infrastructure as code, and auto-scaling.
- **Loose Coupling**: Break monolithic applications into smaller, independent components to prevent cascading failures.
- **Services Over Servers**: Prefer managed services, databases, and serverless solutions over traditional EC2 instances.
